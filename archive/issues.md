# Things I need to fix / work on
* I need to create a new README for the GUI
* Need to create a helper function (in GUI and CLI) that creates appropriate structures for the program to work
* Need to use `which` or whatever the hell the MATLAB function is called that can identify the names of workspace variables so that we do not have to depend on structure being named exactly courseInfo
* Add timestamp function and store in a new array so we can graph frequency of question asking
* Re-write CLI functions to work with structures.
* Graphs need to be able to update
*
